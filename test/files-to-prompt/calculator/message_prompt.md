# Code Review Request

I've implemented a Polish notation calculator in Scheme with a shell script wrapper and Makefile. Please review my code for correctness, error handling, and overall quality.

I'm particularly interested in:
- Whether the calculator correctly handles Polish notation expressions
- If there are any edge cases I'm missing
- How well the shell script works as a wrapper
- General improvements for maintainability

Thank you for your detailed review!
