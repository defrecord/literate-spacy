# Code Review Request

Please review the code in these files using the **Maintainability Advocate** persona. I'm particularly concerned about:

1. The organization of the code
2. Quality of documentation
3. Consistent style across files
4. Potential improvements for long-term maintenance

I would appreciate specific examples of how I could improve the code to make it more maintainable.

Thank you!
