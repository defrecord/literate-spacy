# Tangle/Detangle Tests Findings

## Background
We created multiple tests to debug the tangle/detangle workflow issue (#7) - specifically the problem with bidirectional editing where changes to a Python file weren't being detangled back to the org file.

## Test Results

1. **Basic Test** (`test.org` → `test.py`)
   - Tangle: ✅ Works - changes in org file get tangled to Python file
   - Detangle: ❌ Fails - "Detangled 0 code blocks" with no updates to org file

2. **Alternative Test** (`alt_test.org` → `alt_test.py`)
   - Added `tangle-source` header to Python file
   - Added named block to org file
   - Detangle: ❌ Still fails - "Detangled 0 code blocks"

3. **Link Test** (`link_test.org` → `link_test.py`)
   - Added local variables with explicit tangle link
   - Detangle: ❌ Still fails - "Detangled 0 code blocks"

## Key Issues Identified

1. The `org-babel-detangle` function appears to be looking for specific headers or markers that our code blocks don't have
2. Despite using various combinations of tangle headers, named blocks, and local variables, detangle still fails
3. The documentation for `org-babel-detangle` is limited and doesn't clarify what's needed for it to work

## Recommendations

1. **Use Direct Approach**: Instead of relying on automatic detangle, use a simple script to:
   - Parse Python files for changes
   - Update org files accordingly
   - This would be more reliable than fighting with the org-babel-detangle limitations

2. **Update Makefile**: Implement custom detangle functionality:
   ```makefile
   detangle:
       @echo "Detangling Python files back to org files..."
       @python scripts/manual_detangle.py
   ```

3. **Create Documentation**: Document the limitations of org-babel-detangle and provide clear instructions on the workflow:
   - Prefer making changes to org files
   - Tangle to Python files
   - Avoid editing Python files directly when possible

## Next Steps

1. Create a simple Python script that can:
   - Identify changed Python files
   - Extract their content
   - Update the corresponding source block in the org file
   - Save the updated org file

2. Test this solution with our codebase

3. Update the Makefile with the new approach
