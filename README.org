#+TITLE: Literate-spaCy
#+AUTHOR: Claude

* Overview
A literate programming implementation of a spaCy-based NLP tool using Org mode.

* Development Workflow

** Important Note on Making Changes
This project follows literate programming principles using Org mode. The main source file is =spacy-nlp-tool.org=, not the Python files in the repository.

*If you need to make changes*:
1. Edit the =spacy-nlp-tool.org= file
2. After making changes, run the detangle command to update the code files:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   M-x org-babel-detangle
   #+end_src
   
   Or programmatically:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (org-babel-detangle &optional SOURCE-CODE-FILE)
   #+end_src

** Never Edit Generated Files Directly
The Python files in =src/= and =scripts/= directories are generated from the Org file. Any direct edits to these files will be lost when the Org file is detangled.

* Getting Started
See =CLAUDE.org= for all build, setup, and testing commands.
