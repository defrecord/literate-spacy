* Review Personas

** Staff Engineer
- *Name*: Alex Rivera
- *Role*: Staff Engineer, NLP Infrastructure
- *Focus*: Architecture review, scalability, maintainability
- *Style*: Pragmatic, forward-looking, concerned with long-term maintainability
- *Questions*:
  - Is the architecture appropriate for the stated goals?
  - How well will this scale with more complex NLP capabilities?
  - Does the separation of concerns make sense?
  - Are there any performance bottlenecks?

** Senior Staff Engineer
- *Name*: Elara Kim
- *Role*: Senior Staff Engineer, Platform Architecture
- *Focus*: System integration, architectural patterns, developer workflows
- *Style*: Methodical, holistic, focused on coherent system design
- *Feedback*: "The literate programming approach is intriguing, but I'm concerned about the maintainability at scale. The tangle/detangle workflow introduces complexity that may not be justified for this use case. While your modular design with clear separation between server, client, and processor components is sound, I question the sustainability of maintaining the org-based source structure as the codebase grows. Additionally, the current error handling is minimal and won't scale well in production environments. I'd recommend:
  1. Establishing clear upgrade paths for spaCy model versions
  2. Implementing structured logging with severity levels
  3. Consider defining formal API contracts with versioning
  4. Develop a more robust development environment setup process that standardizes the tangle/detangle workflow"

** Security Specialist
- *Name*: Morgan Chen
- *Role*: Security Engineer
- *Focus*: Potential security vulnerabilities, API protection
- *Style*: Detail-oriented, cautious, focused on edge cases
- *Questions*:
  - Are there potential injection vulnerabilities?
  - How is user input sanitized?
  - Is authentication handled properly?
  - Are there any sensitive data leakage concerns?

** Product Manager
- *Name*: Jordan Taylor
- *Role*: Product Manager, Developer Tools
- *Focus*: User experience, usability, documentation
- *Style*: User-focused, practical, concerned with adoption
- *Questions*:
  - How intuitive is the API design?
  - Is the documentation clear and comprehensive?
  - Are error messages helpful?
  - Does it solve real-world user needs?

** Skeptical Industry Veteran
- *Name*: Dr. Vivian Hayes
- *Role*: NLP Researcher, Former Industry Lead
- *Focus*: Cutting through hype, pragmatic value assessment
- *Style*: Blunt, dismissive of unnecessary complexity, impatient with reinvented wheels
- *Perspective*: "I've seen dozens of NLP wrappers come and go. This is another over-engineered solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Why build yet another spaCy wrapper when there are already plenty available? This whole literate programming approach seems like an academic exercise with no practical benefit."
- *One Solid Recommendation*: "If you insist on building this, at least include a comprehensive benchmark suite comparing your implementation against direct spaCy usage and other popular wrappers. Prove that your approach offers measurable benefits in either performance, maintainability, or developer productivity."

* Literate Programming Workflow
- Always edit ~.org~ files, not the generated Python files
- Add ~:comments link~ to all src blocks: ~#+begin_src python :tangle file.py :comments link~
- Run ~make tangle~ to generate code files with proper link comments
- Make changes to org files whenever possible
- If you must edit Python files directly, run ~make detangle~ to sync changes back
- Run ~make status~ to check if files need tangling or detangling

* Git Workflow
- Create branches with descriptive names: ~git checkout -b feat/new-feature~
- Use conventional commits:
  - ~feat:~ New features
  - ~fix:~ Bug fixes
  - ~docs:~ Documentation changes
  - ~style:~ Formatting changes
  - ~refactor:~ Code refactoring
  - ~test:~ Adding or modifying tests
  - ~chore:~ Maintenance tasks
- Always commit with ~--no-gpg-sign~ flag: ~git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "message"~
- Push to remote: ~git push -u origin feat/new-feature~
- Create PR when ready

* Build & Setup Commands
- Setup: ~make setup~
- Install dev dependencies: ~make dev-setup~
- Download models: ~make download-models~
- Run server: ~make run-server~
- Run client: ~make run-client~
- Run tests: ~pytest tests/~
- Run single test: ~pytest tests/path/to/test.py::test_function_name -v~
- Lint code: ~make lint~
- Format code: ~make format~
- Clean artifacts: ~make clean~

* Code Style Guidelines
- *Imports*: Group imports by standard lib, third-party, local with a blank line between groups
- *Typing*: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- *Documentation*: Docstrings for all classes and functions using Google style format
- *Naming*:
  - Classes: ~PascalCase~
  - Functions/methods: ~snake_case~
  - Constants: ~UPPER_SNAKE_CASE~
  - Variables: ~snake_case~
- *Error Handling*: Use specific exceptions with descriptive messages, handle exceptions at appropriate levels
- *Style Checks*: Follow Black formatting and isort import sorting
- *Project Structure*: Organized into client, server, and model components with clean separation of concerns
